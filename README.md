# ChessAnalysis

A chess analyzer that takes a FEN and asks an LLM to analyse it.



##### Packages

At the moment I don't provide a compiled version, so you'll have to install the various packages that are used.



##### Platforms

It should work with any mainstream OS, but I have not checked. 

Please open an issue if it doesn't.
